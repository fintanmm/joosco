# Joosco Extension v0.1

Joosco is an extension for the Joomla! Content Management System.
You need to have a working installation of Joomla!, version 1.5 (RC2 or above) to use the extension.

Joosco aims to give access to users' documents in a corporate portal, using the Joomla! Framework and the
Alfresco file management system.

In a nutshell, Joosco is a front-end for Alfresco, in Joomla!.

It works by creating a new entry in a menu in Joomla, called Documents, for example. The users can click
on this link to go to a new page where they can browse through spaces and content of the Alfresco Repository.

The plugin is used to authenticate users to the Alfresco repository. Alfresco users can now log in to Joomla,
and their permissions in Alfresco are used to display only the content they have permission to access.
